# twine-wiscalert
This is a Zombie Apocalypse theme interactive fiction powered by Twine. The story was developed for a class project <a href="http://courses.jamesjbrownjr.net/177_spring2014">ENG 177: Literature and Videogames</a> with Professor Brown. I don't own any of the media (music, image) content that were used in the game. The stylesheet was based on <a href="http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/LD25/CYBERQUEEN.html">Cyberqueen</a>. Credits for the authors and media content were cited at the ending of the game.
Enjoy! :)
